				QCPL is an independent, third-party assessment body without affiliation to any other company or organization. It assesses a wide range of manufacturing and service industries throughout India and worldwide.
				<br><br><b>QCPL - The Company </b>
				Quest Certification Private Limited is managed by Mr.Balasakthivelu Ex-Airman Indian Air Force using his team and with the help of their extensive knowledge of all aspects of the 'quality world'. QCPL has acquired auditors, employees who have knowledge gained through working as quality managers in industries, Lead Assessors/Managers with other assessment bodies

				Small Businesses</b> 
				QCPL's roots lie in providing a service which is affordable for small to medium-sized businesses. However, the company's pricing structure and its philosophy of being approachable on any quality matter have resulted in organisations of all sizes choosing to work with QCPL<br><br><b>

				Use of Industry experts: </b>
				When selecting staff for a particular audit, QCPL will always choose an expert from the industry being assessed. This ensures that the audit process takes place in an air of mutual understanding. There is no conflict arising from a lack of knowledge of the challenges faced in running that particular business.<br><br><b> 

				Documents Reviewed On Site </b>
				QCPL has a policy of visiting companies applying for certification. This enables its documents to be reviewed and provides an opportunity for the auditor or the company representative to discuss any areas of concern before the audit itself. Even more importantly, it provides an opportunity for the company to get to know the auditor, starting to build a rapport. 
				<br><br><br>
				In addition to its primary function of providing companies accredited certification to a wide range of national and international management systems standards, QCPL also offers:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Free preliminary visits to companies seeking registration, to discuss what the process involves.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pre-assessments for companies wishing to experience the audit process and verify the effectiveness of their quality system prior to assessment.
					</li>
						Mandatory Stage I & Stage II audits are carried out for all our clients.
					<li>
						New standards are being added to our portfolio on a regular basis

					</li>
					<li>
					Second party audits to organisations' own quality standards.
						
					</li>
			
				</ul><b>
				QCPL's Track Record</b><br>
				QCPL has certified various clients with different types of scopes. More and more companies are not only realising the benefits of being a 'quality assured firm', but also the benefits of using QCPL.
